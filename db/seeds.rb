    body: "Each of you is at a very interesting point in your lives. Some might even say the most significant inflection point
    in your lives so far.
    By a show of hands, how many of you want to make the most of your high school experience, so you can go to the
    college of your choice?
    How many of you want to be sure you’re picking a career that is both personally rewarding and financially
    lucrative?
    How many of you want to balance your own desires with the expectations of your family, peers, and society?
    How many of you want to feel like you can really truly make a dif erence in the world around you even at a young
    age? That your voice, your thoughts, and your ideas matter?
    How many of you want to find your people and feel like you have a community of like-minded peers supporting
    you on this journey?
    You’re in the right place, here at nXu.
    Every one of you is on the verge of adulthood. You have more responsibility than ever before both at school and
    in all aspects of your life and you have more power than ever before to shape the course of your future. But in
    order to answer those larger practical questions, there are first a series of important existential questions you
    have to answer for yourself:
    ● Who am I?
    ● Why am I here?
    ● What is my purpose in life?
    Unlike other questions in life, you can’t just google the answer, or ask the teacher for the answer, or copy your
    friend’s answer at the last minute. You have to find the answer yourself and look within. nXu is all about helping
    you live the questions so you can find the answers for yourself. This is a journey. And a journey of the most
    important work you can and will do in your lives.
    And every journey needs a compass. Your purpose will act as your inner compass. Here at nXu, we define
    purpose as a guiding intention which sits at the intersection of what you’re good at, what you enjoy, and what
    needs in the world activate you.",

    What anyone like to share out their favorite benefits of developing a sense of purpose in life?

    So many benefits and crazy enough, it’s not taught in schools, and most adults don’t even use it or explore it
    effectively.

    Not to be grim but do you want to guess what the number one regret of the dying is? As they lay on their
    deathbeds, reflecting on their lives, what do they regret the most?

    'I wish I had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.'",

    title: 'Reading: Writing A Purpose Statement',
    header: "The Parts Of A Purpose Statement",
    body: "Writing a purpose statement is simple. It's broken down into three parts, which we are familiar with:
            1. What You Are Good At
            2. What You Enjoy
            3. What Needs In The World Activate You
            
            If you spent some time thinking about those three components, crafting a purpose statement looks a bit like this:

            My purpose in life is to use my [insert strengths here] combined with my [insert interests here] to [insert the what the world needs you do to].
                
            It's pretty daunting to write this statement. What if it changes? What if you suddenly don't feel so strongly about it. 
            All of this is totally valid, and completely okay. The important part in your journey is making the first step in attempting
            to commit yourself to something, so that you can begin making steps towards learning about it, and from that, growing in meaningful
            ways according to your own personal direction.",
